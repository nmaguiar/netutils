## ‚öôÔ∏è  Deploy using kubectl 

{{{$acolor 'FAINT,ITALIC' 'kubectl run netutils --rm -it --image nmaguiar/netutils -- /bin/bash'}}}

**Attach to a container to debug:**

{{{$acolor 'FAINT,ITALIC' 'kubectl debug pod-to-debug -it --image nmaguiar/netutils --target=container-to-debug --profile=netadmin -- /bin/bash'}}}

Profiles:

| Profile | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| netadmin | Network Administrator privileges (NET_ADMIN and NET_RAW). |
| sysadmin | System Administrator (root) privileges. |
| general | A reasonable set of defaults tailored for each debuging journey (SYS_PTRACE). |
| auto | Automatically choose between general, baseline, and restricted. |

**Start in a specific node:**

{{{$acolor 'FAINT,ITALIC' 'NODENAME=node-server-0 NAME=netutils NS=kube-system  /bin/sh -c \'kubectl run -n $NS $NAME --rm -ti --image=nmaguiar/netutils  --overrides="{\"apiVersion\":\"v1\",\"spec\":{\"nodeName\":\"$NODENAME\",\"containers\":[{\"name\":\"$NAME\",\"image\":\"nmaguiar/netutils\",\"stdin\":true,\"stdinOnce\":true,\"tty\":true,\"args\":[\"/bin/bash\"]}]}}" -- /bin/bash\''}}}

**Host network:**

{{{$acolor 'FAINT,ITALIC' 'NODENAME=node-server-0 NAME=netutils NS=kube-system  /bin/sh -c \'kubectl run -n $NS $NAME --rm -ti --image=nmaguiar/netutils  --overrides="{\"apiVersion\":\"v1\",\"spec\":{\"hostNetwork\":true,\"nodeName\":\"$NODENAME\",\"containers\":[{\"name\":\"$NAME\",\"image\":\"nmaguiar/netutils\",\"stdin\":true,\"stdinOnce\":true,\"tty\":true,\"args\":[\"/bin/bash\"]}]}}" -- /bin/bash\''}}}
