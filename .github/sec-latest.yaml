    Title: 'python: Virtual environment (venv) activation scripts don''t quote paths'
    Description: A vulnerability has been found in the CPython `venv` module and CLI where path names provided when creating a virtual environment were not quoted properly, allowing the creator to inject commands into virtual environment "activation" scripts (ie "source venv/bin/activate"). This means that attacker-controlled virtual environments are able to run commands when the virtual environment is activated. Virtual environments which are not created by an attacker or which aren't activated before being used (ie "./venv/bin/python") are not affected.

    Description: |-
      Starting in Python 3.12.0, the asyncio._SelectorSocketTransport.writelines()
       method would not "pause" writing and signal to the Protocol to drain 
      the buffer to the wire once the write buffer reached the "high-water 
      mark". Because of this, Protocols would not periodically drain the write
       buffer potentially leading to memory exhaustion.





      This
       vulnerability likely impacts a small number of users, you must be using
       Python 3.12.0 or later, on macOS or Linux, using the asyncio module 
      with protocols, and using .writelines() method which had new 
      zero-copy-on-write behavior in Python 3.12.0 and later. If not all of 
      these factors are true then your usage of Python is unaffected.

    Title: 'python: Virtual environment (venv) activation scripts don''t quote paths'
    Description: A vulnerability has been found in the CPython `venv` module and CLI where path names provided when creating a virtual environment were not quoted properly, allowing the creator to inject commands into virtual environment "activation" scripts (ie "source venv/bin/activate"). This means that attacker-controlled virtual environments are able to run commands when the virtual environment is activated. Virtual environments which are not created by an attacker or which aren't activated before being used (ie "./venv/bin/python") are not affected.

    Title: Starting in Python 3.12.0, the asyncio._SelectorSocketTransport.writel ...
    Description: |-
      Starting in Python 3.12.0, the asyncio._SelectorSocketTransport.writelines()
       method would not "pause" writing and signal to the Protocol to drain 
      the buffer to the wire once the write buffer reached the "high-water 
      mark". Because of this, Protocols would not periodically drain the write
       buffer potentially leading to memory exhaustion.





      This
       vulnerability likely impacts a small number of users, you must be using
       Python 3.12.0 or later, on macOS or Linux, using the asyncio module 
      with protocols, and using .writelines() method which had new 
      zero-copy-on-write behavior in Python 3.12.0 and later. If not all of 
      these factors are true then your usage of Python is unaffected.
